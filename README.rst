 Gerrit Dashboard Creator
==========================

Creates custom urls for gerrit dashboards

The Problem
===========

The Gerrit Review system is great, until it gets completely out of
control with too much content in it. When you are staring at a single
list of 400 reviews, it's completely overwhelming.

Sisyphus never had it so good.

The Solution
============

I've found that slicing up the giant review task into a set of smaller
buckets that you can see actually get smaller as you go through them
becomes a far more motivating way of looking at reviews.

As of gerrit 2.6 there is support for building custom dashboards, both
on the server side, and on the client side (as a url). These are
really powerful.

The server side defintion for these dashboards is pretty easy to
understand, however you need really extreme levels of permissions to
create these dashboards. The client side definition is a single url
which is hard to manipulate inline.

This tool takes the server side definition, creates the client side
encoding of it, and spits that url out on the command line. You can
then load it in your browser and off you go.

Usage
=====

It's super easy, just check out the code, and pass it 1 arg, which is
the dash file you want the url for::

  > ./gerrit-dash-creator dashboards/devstack.dash

  URL for Devstack Review Inbox

Then put the url in your browser and off you go.

If you want to run a small webserver that maintains a list of all
urls from all the dashboards, you can execute the script with the
"--webserver" flag as follows::

  > ./gerrit-dash-creator --webserver

This will read all of the .dash files in the "dashboards" directory
and create a list of all the URLs.  The webserver is accessible at
http://localhost:8080/ with a JSON endpoint at
http://localhost:8080/json/
